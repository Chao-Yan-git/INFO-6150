            <h2>Elephant Dung Coffee</h2>>
            <h2><b><kbd>A few years back, the popular movie “The Bucket List” let the pop culture world in on a little known weird fact about coffee: that kopi luwak, a highly prized, extremely expensive coffee, was made with beans that had been harvested from the poop of civets. Since then, variations of kopi luwak pop up every few years as a fad coffee. Last year it was elephant poop coffee. In late 2012 and continuing into the early months of 2013, Black Ivory Coffee from Thailand — made from coffee beans that had been eaten and “processed” by elephants — held the title of most expensive coffee in the world. The regular price of the coffee is $1,100 per kilogram, and it sells at some luxury hotels for about $50 US per cup.And, unlike kopi luwak, which has become somewhat controversial of late because of the inhumane treatment of many of the civets who produce the coffee, the Black Ivory Coffee Company is produced by rescue elephants living in an elephant refuge, where they are treated very well. But if you think picking coffee beans out of elephant dung is as weird as it gets, you haven’t been paying attention the wild and wonderful world of coffee over the past year. Here are just a few of the other coffee-related stories that have hit the headlines in the past year.</kbd></b></h2>
